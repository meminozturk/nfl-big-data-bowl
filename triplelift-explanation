As title said,the model we used just embedding playerâ€™s basic feature and projections by friend group and ravel group then sum it up because it can bring symmetry for everyone.
The only trick thing we use is data enhancement.Flip the variables up and down along the X axis.
The total running time is about 2800s.
Scored 0.01277 on LB.

Did you use GraphNN?
No,only attention+embedding+MLP
